<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I am an Associate Professor of Operations at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/). My research interests focus on designing incentives, such as pricing and information, to enhance the operational efficiency of firms in a fair and transparent manner. Sector-wise, I am interested in sharing economy, online platforms, and supply chains in general.

I received a Ph.D. in Operations Management from [Rotman School of Management](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. I also hold a Master in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) from University of Toronto, and a Bachelor in [Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from Tsinghua University. 

**To prospective students:** I am seeking highly motivated PhD students and research assistants (RAs) with a strong mathematical background to join my research team. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to send an email along with your CV, transcripts, and any other documents that showcase your research capabilities and potential.
